                <h1 style="color: violet;"> Description </h1>
            <p> OV.Seva or Online Voting Seva is a Blockchain based online voting system. Wherein we as creators have provided a voting system,
                wherein every user can regsister himself/herself as either a voter or a candidate and can cast vote to a candidate according to their
                choice after thorough verification of their details from the back-end server, storing the data.<br><br>
                OV.Seva would allow each and every user to cast their vote fairly and securely, as Blockchain technology is the backbone of this whole system.
                Blockchain allows the user/client to work upon events securely as it stores the data in the form of blocks containing three major portions which are:
                <br>
                1) Time Stamp of the block (when was the block created)<br>
                2) Data to be stored (E.g. Transaction data, Voting data)<br>
                3) Hash of the previous block - making it impossible to hack or crackdown<br><br>
                <h2 style="color: violet"> Advantages </h2>
            <p>1) Each and every person can cast their vote easily, securely, anytime and anywhere.<br>
            2) Need not to wait in long queues for voting, thus time-saving system.<br>3)It has great potential to decrease organizational costs and increase voter turnout. It eliminates the need to print ballot papers or open polling stations-voters can vote from wherever there is an Internet connection.</p>
